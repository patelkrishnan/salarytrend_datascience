The dataset, "Jobs and Salaries in Data Science," is sourced from Kaggle. It provides comprehensive information on salaries and related factors within the data science field. The dataset encompasses various attributes such as job title, job category, salary in multiple currencies, employee residence, experience level, employment type, work setting, company location, and company size. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for analyzing salary trends, comparing salaries across different roles and regions, and understanding the factors influencing salary structures within the data industry.

Based on the dataset, we focused on analyzing five key variables: Work Year, Job title, Salary (in USD), Experience Level, and Employee Residence. We conducted a comprehensive analysis to derive insights from the summary statistics of these variables.

At the conclusion of the analysis, an interactive RMarkdown report was generated. This report includes interactive graphs to visualize the insights gathered from the summary statistics, providing a dynamic and comprehensive overview of the findings.
